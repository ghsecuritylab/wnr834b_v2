<h1>Remote Management Help</h1>

<p>
	Using the Remote Management menu, you can allow a user on the Internet to configure, upgrade and check the status of your router.</p>
<p>
	<b>IMPORTANT: </b><i>Be sure to change the router's default password to a very secure password.</i></p>

<p><b>Remote Management Address</b></p>
<p>
This is the current address you will use when accessing your router from the Internet. To access the router, you will type your router's WAN IP address into your browser's Address (in IE) or Location (in Netscape) box, followed by a colon (:) and the custom port number. For example, if your
external address is 10.0.0.123 and you use port number 8080, enter in your
browser:</p>

 <p><screen>http://10.0.0.123:8080</screen></p>

<hr>
<a name="access"></a>
<p><b>Allow Remote Access</b>

<p>	For security, you should restrict access to as few external IP addresses as practical. 

<p><ul>Click <b>Only This Computer</b> to allow access by only one IP address.</ul>

<p><ul>Click <b> IP Address Range</b> to allow access from a range of IP addresses on the Internet, enter a beginning and ending IP address to define the allowed range.</ul>

<p><ul>Click <b>Everyone</b> to allow access by everyone on the Internet.</ul>



<hr>
<a name="port"></a>
<h2>Port Number</h2>
<p>Web browser access normally uses the standard HTTP service port 80. For
greater security, you can change the remote management web interface to a custom
port by entering that number in the box provided. Choose a number between
1024 and 65534, but do not use the number of any common service port.
