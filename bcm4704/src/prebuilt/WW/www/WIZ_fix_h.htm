<h2 class="helpfile">Internet IP Address </h2>

<p>If you log in to your service or your ISP did not provide you with a fixed IP 
address, the router will find an IP address for you automatically when you connect. 
Select <b>Get Dynamically From ISP</b>. </p>

<p>If you have a fixed (static, permanent) IP address, your ISP will have provided you 
with the required information. Select <b>Use Static IP Address</b> and type the 
IP Address, Subnet Mask and Gateway IP Address into the correct boxes. </p>

<p>The IP Address is your personal address, and the Gateway IP Address is the address of
your ISP's router. If you can't determine your subnet mask, try 255.255.255.0. </p>

<a name="DNSaddress"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Domain Name Server (DNS) Address </h2>

<p>The DNS server is used to look up site addresses based on their names. </p>

<p>If your ISP gave you one or two DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers</b> and 
type the primary and secondary addresses. </p>

<p>Otherwise, select <b>Get Automatically From ISP</b>. </p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you get 'Address not found' errors when you go to a Web site, 
it is likely that your DNS servers aren't set up properly. You should contact your 
ISP to get DNS server addresses. </p>
