<h1>Basic Settings Help</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are setting up the router for the first time, the default settings may work for you with no changes.

<a name=question></a>
<p><b>Does Your Internet Connection Require A Login?</b> 
<p>Select this option based on the type of account you have with your ISP. If you need to enter login information every time you connect to the Internet or you have a PPPoE account with your ISP, select <b>Yes</b>. Otherwise, select <b>No</b>. </p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you have installed PPP software such as WinPoET (from Earthlink) or Enternet (from PacBell), then you have PPPoE. Select Yes. After selecting Yes and configuring your router, you will not need to run the PPP software on your PC to connect to the Internet. </p>

<a name="isp"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Internet Service Provider</h2>
<p>Select the service provided by your ISP. "Other" (PPPoE) is the most common.
"PPTP" is used in Austria and other European countries. "Telstra BigPond" is for Australia only.</p>


<a name="login"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Login </h2>

<p>This is usually the name that
you use in your e-mail address. For example, if your main mail account is
JerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this box. </p>

<p>Some ISPs (like Mindspring, Earthlink, and T-DSL) require that you use your full e-mail address when you log in. If your ISP requires your full e-mail address, then type it in the Login box. </p>

<a name="password"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Password</h2>

<p>Type the password that you use
to log in to your ISP. </p>

<a name="conn_mode"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Connection Mode</h2>
<p>Set the Connection Mode to Dial on Demand, Always On, or Manually Connect.<br>
<p>With the default setting, <b>Dial on Demand</b>, a PPTP connection automatically starts when there is outbound traffic to the Internet, and it automatically terminates if the connection is idle based on the value in the Idle Timeout setting.<br>
<p>When the Connection Mode is set to <b>Always On</b>, the PPTP connection automatically starts when the computer boots up, but the connection does not time out. The router will keep trying to bring up the connection if it is disconnected for some reason.<br>
<p>If you select <b>Manually Connect</b>, you must go to the Router Status screen and click the Connect button in order to connect to the Internet. The manual connection does not time out and you have to click the Disconnect button on the Router Status screen to disconnect it.</p>


<a name="idletime"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Idle Timeout</h2>
<p>An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period.
<p>If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be "kept alive" by re-connecting immediately whenever the connection is lost.</p>

<a name="myip"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">My IP Address</h2>
<p>If your ISP gave you a fixed IP address, such as 10.0.0.140, enter it here.
Otherwise, leave this at 0.0.0.0 You will then be allocated an IP address automatically when you connect.</p>

<a name="serverip"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Server Address</h2>
<p>
Server Address
If your ISP gave you the IP address of your ISP's server, such as 10.0.0.138, enter it here. If your ISP gave you a domain name of the server, such as vpn.corbina.net, you can enter the name here.
</p>

<a name="gwip"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Gateway IP Address</h2>
<p>
If you have a fixed (or static IP) address for "My IP Address", your ISP should have also provided you with a "Gateway IP Address". You need to enter the "Gateway IP Address" here.
If you use DHCP client to get "My IP Address" or your service provider requires you to leave "My IP Address" blank, there is no need to enter a "Gateway IP address".
</p>

<a name="id"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Connection ID/Name</h2>
<p>Most of the time the ID/Name should be left blank. However, if your ISP provided you one, please enter the connection ID here.</p>


<a name="DNSaddress"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Domain Name Server (DNS)
Address </h2>

<p>The DNS server is used to look
up site addresses based on their names. </p>

<p>If your ISP gave you one or two
DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers </b>and type the primary and
secondary addresses. </p>

<p>Otherwise, select <b>Get
Automatically From ISP</b>. </p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you get
'Address not found' errors when you go to a Web site, it is likely that your
DNS servers aren't set up properly. You should contact your ISP to get DNS
server addresses. </p>


<h2 class="helpfile"><a name=localaddress></a>Router MAC Address </h2>

<p>Each computer or router on your network has a unique 32-bit local Ethernet address. 
This is also referred to as the computer's MAC (Media Access Control) address. </p>

<p>Usually, select <b>Use Default Address</b>.</p>

<p>If your ISP requires MAC authentication, then select 
either <b>Use Computer MAC Address </b>to have the router use the MAC address 
of the computer you are now using, or <b>Use This MAC Address </b>to manually type in
the MAC address that your ISP expects.</p> 

<p>The format for the MAC address is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. If you select <b>Use This MAC 
Address </b> and type in a MAC address, do not then select <b>Use This Computer's MAC 
Address </b>or your entry will be overwritten.</p>
