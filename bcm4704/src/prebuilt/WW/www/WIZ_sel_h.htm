Smart Setup Wizard Help 
</h1>
<p>After connecting the Router into your network, you must configure it. You can do this using the Smart Setup Wizard -- where the wizard will attempt to auto-detect the type of Internet service you have through your ISP -- or you can configure the router manually. It is recommended that, if you aren't used to setting up Internet connections, you let the Smart Setup Wizard do some of the work for you.
<p>To configure the router, you'll use the information that you filled out earlier in the Installation Guide.
<p>To get started:
<ol> 
<li>Select <b>Yes</b> if you want to use the Smart Setup Wizard.
<br>or
<br>Select <b>No</b> to configure the router manually.
<li>Click <b>Next</b>.
</ol>
