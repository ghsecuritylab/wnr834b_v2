Alerts can be sent when someone on your LAN (Local Area Network) tries to visit a blocked site. Logs are lists of all the URLs that have been visited. If you'd like to have alerts and logs sent to you by e-mail, fill out the settings on this form.
</p>

<p>
You can always check the logs manually by viewing the <i>Logs</i> page. If you don't want to receive e-mails, leave the boxes blank.
