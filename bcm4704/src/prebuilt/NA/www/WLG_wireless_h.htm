<P><B>NOTE:</B> To ensure proper agency compliance and compatibility between 
similar products in your area; the operating channel &amp; region must be set 
correctly. 
<P><B>Placement of the Router to Optimize Wireless Connectivity</B> 
<P>The operating distance or range of your wireless connection can vary
significantly based on the physical placement of the router. For best results,
place your router:
<UL>
  <LI>Near the center of the area in which your PCs will operate,
  <LI>In an elevated location such as a high shelf,
  <LI>Away from potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwave ovens, and 
  cordless phones,
  <LI>Away from large metal surfaces. </LI></UL>
<P><B>Note:</B> Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant
performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the router.</P> 
<HR>
<A name=network></A>
<P><B>Wireless Network</B></P>
<P>Name (SSID)
<P>Enter a value of up to 32 alphanumeric characters. The same Name (SSID) must
be assigned to all wireless devices in your network. The default SSID is 
NETGEAR, but NETGEAR strongly recommends that you change your network's Name 
(SSID) to a different value. This value is also case-sensitive. For example, 
<I>NETGEAR</I> is not the same as <I>NETGEAr</I>.
<P>Region
<P>Select your region from the drop-down list. This field displays the region of 
operation for which the wireless interface is intended. It may not be legal to 
operate the router in a region other than the region shown here. If your country 
or region is not listed, please check with your local government agency or check
our website for more information on which channels to use.
<P>Channel
<P>This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It should not
be necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference
problems with another nearby access point.</P>
<P>Mode
<P>Select the desired wireless mode. The options are:
<UL>
  <LI>Up to 54 Mbps - Legacy Mode with maximum speed of up to 54 Mbps for b/g networks.
  <LI>Up to 130 Mbps - Neighbor Friendly Mode - Default speed up to 130 Mbps in presence of neighboring wireless networks.
  <LI>Up to 270 Mbps - Performance Mode - Maximum Wireless-N speed up to 270 Mbps.
</LI></UL>
<P>The default is "Up to 130Mbps", which allows all 11b and 11g wireless stations. The NETGEAR WN511B runs at 130 Mbps when accessing this router. </P>
<HR>
<A name=security></A>
<P><B>Security Options</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI>None - no data encryption
  <LI>WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy, use WEP 64- or 128-bit data encryption<br>
  <b>Note:</b> &nbsp; Wi-Fi Protected Setup function is disabled when the security setting is WEP with Auto/Shared-Key authentication.  
  <LI>WPA-PSK [TKIP] - Wi-Fi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA-PSK standard encryption with TKIP encryption type
  <LI>WPA2-PSK [AES] - Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2 with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA2-PSK standard encryption with the AES encryption type
  <LI>WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES] - Allow clients using either WPA-PSK [TKIP] or WPA2-PSK [AES]
</LI></UL>

<p>To achieve the best performance with NETGEAR WN511B or other wireless
adapters under robust security network, NETGEAR recommends that you
change your WNR834B network's security option to WPA2-PSK. 

<!--<p>The WEP and WPA-PSK security options are still supported under "Up to 54
Mbps" legacy b/g network, but not available under 130 Mbps and 270 Mbps
modes now.--></p>

<HR>
<A name=wep></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WEP)</B>
<P>Authentication Type
<P>Normally this can be left at the default value of "Automatic." If that fails,
select the appropriate value - "Open System" or "Shared Key" Check your 
wireless card's documentation to see what method to use.  
<P>Encryption Strength
<P>Select the WEP Encryption level:
<UL>
  <LI>64-bit (sometimes called 40-bit) encryption
  <LI>128-bit encryption </LI></UL>
<HR>
<A name=wepkey></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WEP) Key</B></P>
<P>If WEP is enabled, you can manually or automatically program the four data 
encryption keys. These values must be identical on all PCs and Access Points in
your network.
<P>Automatic Key Generation (Passphrase)
<P>Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box and click
the Generate button to automatically configure the WEP Key(s). If encryption
strength is set to 64 bit, then each of the four key boxes will automatically be
populated with key values. If encryption strength is set to 128 bit, then only
the selected WEP key box will automatically be populated with key values.
<P>Manual Entry Mode
<P>Select which of the four keys will be used, and enter the matching WEP key 
information for your network in the selected key box.
<P>For 64-bit WEP - Enter ten hexadecimal digits (any combination of 0-9, A-F). 
<P>For 128-bit WEP - Enter twenty-six hexadecimal digits (any combination of 
0-9, A-F).
<P>Be sure to click Apply to save your settings in this menu.</P>

<A name=wpa-psk></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA-PSK)</B></P>
<P>If selected, you must use TKIP encryption, and enter the WPA passphrase (Network key). Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
<P>Be sure to click Apply to save your settings. </p>
<HR>
<A name=wpa2-psk></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA2-PSK)</B></P>
<P>WPA2 is a newer version of WPA. Only select this if all the wireless clients in your network support WPA2. If selected, you must use AES encryption, and enter the WPA passphrase (Network key). 
Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
<HR>
<A name=wpa-psk+wpa2-psk></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA-PSK + WPA2-PSK)</B></P>
<P>This selection allows clients to use either WPA (with TKIP, broadcast packets also use TKIP.) or WPA2 (with AES). If selected, encryption must be TKIP + AES. The WPA passphrase (Network key) must also be entered. To reach maximum wireless performance, the client like WN511B must connect to this router using WPA2(with AES) .  For clients connecting in WPA-PSK( with TKIP), the maximum wireless speed will be at 802.11g.
Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
