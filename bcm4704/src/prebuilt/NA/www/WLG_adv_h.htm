<P>Enable Wireless Router Radio 
<P>The Wireless Access Point Router of this router can be enabled or disabled to 
allow wireless access. The wireless icon on the front of the router will also 
display the current status of the Wireless Access Point to let you know if it 
is disabled or enabled. If Enabled, wireless stations will be able to access the 
Internet. If Disabled, wireless stations will not be able to access the 
Internet.</P> 
<P>Enable SSID Broadcast
<P>If Enabled, the Wireless RouterSSID will broadcast its name (SSID) to all 
Wireless Stations. Stations which have no SSID (or a "null" value) can then 
adopt the correct SSID for connections to this Access Point.</P>
<P>Fragmentation Threshold, CTS/RTS Threshold, Preamble Mode
<P>These settings are reserved for wireless testing and advanced configuration 
only. Do not change these settings.</P>

<p>Router's PIN
<p>This is the PIN number you use on a registrar (e.g. from the Network Explorer on a Vista Windows PC) 
to configure the router's wireless settings through WPS. <BR>
You can also find the PIN on the router's product label too.
<p>Disable Router's PIN
<p>Only when the router's PIN is enabled, you can configure the router's wireless settings or add a 
wireless client through WPS with the router's PIN number. 
This Router's PIN function may temporarily be disabled when the router detects suspicous attemtps
to break into the router's wireless settings by using the router's PIN through WPS. Users can manually
enable this function by unchecking the option and clicking the Apply button.
<p>Keep Existing Wireless Settings
<p>This shows whether the router is in the WPS Configured state.<br>
If the this option is not checked, adding a new wireless client will change the router's wireless
settings to an automacically generated random SSID and security key. Besides, if this option is checked,
some external registrar (e.g. Network Explorer on Vista Windows) may not see the router.<br>
Configuring basic wireless settings from the router's management GUI makes this option checked.

<P><B>Wireless Card Access List</B></P>
<P>By default, any wireless PC that is configured with the correct SSID will be 
allowed access to your wireless network. For increased security, you can 
restrict access to the wireless network to only allow specific PCs based on 
their MAC addresses. From the Wireless Settings menu, click the Setup Access 
List button to display the Wireless Access List menu.</P>
