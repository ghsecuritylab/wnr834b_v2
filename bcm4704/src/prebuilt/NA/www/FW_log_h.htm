<h1>Logs Help</h1> 
<p>

A log is a detailed record of the Web sites that users on your network have accessed or attempted to access. If you have set up content filtering on the <i>Block Sites</i> page, the <i>Logs</i> page shows you when someone on your network tried to access a blocked site. If you have e-mail notification on, you'll receive these logs in an e-mail message. If you don't have e-mail notification set up, you can view the logs here.
